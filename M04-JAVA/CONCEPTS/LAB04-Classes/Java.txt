JAVA LANGUAGE FEATURES
    DATA TYPES
        Primitives
            int
            float
        Complex
            Strings
            Arrys
    
    CLASSES
        Are sets of:
            - properties (variables - state)
            - methods    (functions - behavior)
    
    PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS    
        - OOP Object Oriented Programming Paradigm
            Represent everythins as objects, objects depends on classes
            
        - Functional (Java 8 lambdas)
            It works with the function flow:
                - Data is sent to funtions
                - Functions process those data
                - Functions return processed data
                - Developer use those processed data to modify the application state or behavior
        
        - Reactive (Based on the PubSub/Obsever Design Pattern)
            When a state is changed, some object fires an Event

        
        OOP PILLARS
            - Abstraction
                - Show only essential elements
                - Hide complexity
            - Encapsulation
                - The inner logic in clases is limited
                    - private, public
            - Inheritance
                - A class is a base for derived classes
                    (Bad practice)
                    Two independent classes, duplicated data
                        Person: name, age, address, etc
                        Student: name, age, address, etc
                    (Better option)
                    Student inherits or extends from Person
                        Person -> Student
            - Polymorphism
                - Animal eat( "food" )
                - Animal -> Bird
                - Animal -> Feline
                - Bird -> Penguin -> eat( "fish" )
                - Bird -> Duck -> eat( "worm" )
                - Bird -> Seagul -> eat( "fish" )
                - Feline -> Cat -> eat( "tuna" )
